# Maintainers' Code of Conduct:

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

Exceptions **SHOULD** be made by contacting the administration team.

The maintainers:

- **MUST** uploads changelogs for each build. These **MUST** be user-friendly.

- **MUST** test every build before sending an OTA update to users. Each build must be thoroughly vetted by the maintainer before it is released, and all hardware and software functionalities **MUST** be tested before a build is released. Releasing untested builds **SHALL** lead to your maintainership being revoked.

- **MUST** ship the Standard/Normal Edition builds monthly.

- **MAY** ship the Plus Builds monthly.

- **MUST** maintain authorship of git commits that are pushed, this is a mandatory requirement for ALL repositories. Force-pushes are acceptable, but try to keep them to a minimum.

- **MUST NOT** get involved in arguments or resort to insults, or use hateful words, personal attacks or any other verbal or nonverbal action that is considered detrimental towards the creation of a positive environment for the team.  

- **MUST** sort disagreements between maintainers out by using direct messages (DMs) on Telegram or XDA.

- **SHOULD** approach the administration if you want something sorted out quickly.

If any of these rules are broken, the administration will take direct action against the maintainer without prior warning.
