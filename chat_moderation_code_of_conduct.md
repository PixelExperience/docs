# Chat Moderation Code of Conduct

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

Exceptions **SHOULD** be made by contacting the administration team.

## Once you are a moderator in one of our chat YOU

- **MUST NOT** be homophobic, transphobic, racist, xenophobic or condone any kind of slander, discrimination or prejudice. Jokes are free of course but there are limits for such.
- **MUST NOT** enforce rules with any bias. Rules broken = Rules broken. No exceptions whatsoever for any person. The same goes for any of the higher ups of the project itself. Common/Good sense are very much welcome in regards to this point.
- **MUST NOT** act as a Public Relationship Manager. Informing users is an act more than welcome, even more so when the project has already published something in regards to a specific matter. However, damage control is not the responsibility of a moderator. A Moderator's responsibility is to enforce rules.
- **MUST NOT** alter any rules, notes or filters in our main chat. Talking to any member in the administration of the project and giving recommendations is more than welcome, however recommendation(s) **MAY** or **MAY NOT**  be accepted.
- **MUST NOT** instigate or partake in any arguments with anyone who is a part of team PixelExperience, including but not limited to:
  - Administrators
  - Maintainers
  - Other chat moderators
If you feel that one of the above committed some wrongdoing, talk to a member of the admin team and sort it out that way. Arguments are not the way to handle any situation..
- **MUST** exhibit the maturity expected from a person in a position of power and not create drama or throw tantrums. As covered in the previous point, feel free to involve someone from the administration team, if you feel the need to.
- **MUST** forward all ban/mute/warn logs to the private moderation group, so all logs can be easily viewed by any moderator to decide further punishments down the line for subsequent rule breaks.

If any of these points are broken by any moderator, the administration of the project will take immediate and swift action against the moderator without prior warning.

## Standard of punishments
- Scam - Ban/FedBan if possible
- Porn - Ban/FedBan if possible
- Aggressive swearing - Warn
- Aggressive swearing after warning - Warn + Temp. mute for 3 days

*: Short conversations in non-English languages are fine as long as itâ€™s made clear to finish whatever is the matter of it as soon as possible or that it's in a joking-ly manner.
